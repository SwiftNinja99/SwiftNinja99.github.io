				<p>Bloons Tower Defense and Bloons Tower Defense 2

					A screenshot of the original Bloons Tower Defense.
					Bloons Tower Defense is the first game in the BTD series, released for free as a flash browser game in Mid 2007.[13] In the game players had to defend against coloured bloons with monkeys, dart throwers, and other towers positioned around the map.[14] When strong bloons are popped they release weaker ones until eventually completely popping. If all lives are lost, the game is over. If all waves are passed, the player will win the game. [5]

					Bloons Tower Defense 2 was released soon after in Late 2007,[13] adding new towers, multiple map options, new bloons, and an option for game difficulty.[15]

				Bloons TD 3

					Bloons TD 3 was released around September 5, 2008, months after the release of Bloons Tower Defense 2, named differently due to a trademark dispute with Com2uS.[12][13] As with the second game, new towers, bloons, and maps were added.[16]

					A version based on this game was released for iOS titled Bloons TD; made available on October 3, 2009 from the iOS App Store.[7] This version had extra maps styled in snow and beach themes,[17] and included OpenFeint achievements.[18]

					The game included 5 map packs, containing a total of 15 different levels to play, with packs unlocked by completing the previous levels.[4] This version of the game was also released for the PlayStation Portable in 2010.[2]

					Another version of the game, simply titled Bloons TD, was released for DSiWare in 2011, containing 50 rounds to complete.[19][20]

				Bloons TD 4
					Bloons TD 4 was released on October 26, 2009 as an online freemium game with a proprietary iOS version released on December 7, 2010, developed in conjunction with Digital Goldfish.[21][22][23] The gameplay underwent changes including a graphical update, the ability to save the current game, and the introduction of an unlock-based leveling system. The tower upgrading system received various changes including increasing the number of upgrades per tower,[13] and new maps and game modes were added.

					iPhone and iPad versions of this title have been purchased over one million times. A version of the game was also released as a DSiWare game in 2012.

			<h1 id="terraria">Terraria</h1>
			<p>
			Terraria was developed by Re-Logic beginning in January 2011,[9] and is built on the Microsoft XNA framework.[10] Re-Logic was composed of Andrew Spinks, who designed and programmed the game, Finn Brice, who along with Spinks did the graphic design for the game, and Jeremy Guerrette, who was a production assistant at Re-Logic, but left shortly after the game's release.[citation needed] The music was composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly.[11] The game was released for Microsoft Windows on May 16, 2011.[12]

			Post-launch, the game has been updated on multiple occasions. In December 2011, Re-Logic updated Terraria to version 1.1, adding new monsters, bosses, NPCs, and items. The update also included improvements to the game's world generation technology and lighting system.[13] In February 2012, the developers announced that they would not be continuing active development, but would release a final bug-fix patch.[14] However, development resumed in 2013 with Spinks asking the community for ideas and features to include in a future content update.[15]

			In September 2012, Spinks announced that Engine Software and 505 Games would be porting Terraria to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[16] The game was released for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on March 27, 2013.[17] The PlayStation 3 version was released via the PlayStation Network in North America on March 26, 2013[17] and in Europe and Australia on May 15, 2013.[18] Shortly after the initial console release, 505 Games announced Terraria for PlayStation Vita;[19] it was released in Europe on December 11, 2013, and in North America on December 17, 2013.[20] Spike Chunsoft localized the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions for release in Japan, including exclusive items such as a costume based on Monokuma from Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.[21][22] In May 2013, 505 Games announced a mobile version of Terraria ported by Dutch studio Codeglue for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.[23] It was released for iOS on August 29, 2013,[24] and for Android on September 13, 2013.[25] The Windows Phone version was released on September 12, 2014.[26][unreliable source?]

			In October 2013, Re-Logic released version 1.2 for Terraria on Windows after nine months in development. The update added a host of new mechanics, gameplay changes, and graphics adjustments.[27] After the 1.2 update was released the game returned to receiving continuous updates, including Halloween and Christmas updates which expanded the endgame significantly.[28][29] The console and mobile versions received update 1.2 in 2014.[30][31] Terraria became DRM-free on October 2, 2014, when it was released on GOG.com.[32]

			A downloadable version of Terraria was released for PlayStation 4 on November 11, 2014, and Xbox One on November 14, 2014,[33][34] with a retail release on December 2, 2014.[35] In September 2014, Re-Logic announced that Terraria would be coming to OS X and Linux.[36] They were both released on August 12, 2015.[37] The Nintendo 3DS version was first released on the Nintendo eShop on December 10, 2015.[38] A Wii U version was released on the eShop in June 2016.[39]

			It was announced that version 1.3, the game's third major content update, would be the last on which Spinks would work personally, and that the developers Yorai Omer and Skiphs would take over programming, and Whitney "Cenx" Baird, would take over as lead designer.[citation needed] Version 1.3 was released on June 30, 2015, adding even more items, events, enemies, bosses, and gameplay features. During July 2016, Cenx announced that 1.3 for the mobile platforms would be coming in 2017.[40]

			On July 25, 2016, 505 Games announced that the 1.3 update would not be ported to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation Vita, citing issues with the consoles' performance. It was also announced that Engine Software and Codeglue would no longer be working on the console and mobile versions respectively and that a new studio, Pipeworks, would take over the development of those versions.[41] A version for the Nintendo Switch, ported by 505 Games, will be released in 2019.[42]

			<h1 id="undertale">Undertale</h1>
			<p>
			Undertale was developed by Toby Fox across 2.7 years.[16] Development was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter. The campaign was launched on June 25, 2013 with a goal of US$5,000; it ended on July 25, 2013, with US$51,124 raised by 2,398 people (1022.48% of the original goal).[17] Undertale's creation ensued after Fox created a battle system using the game creation system GameMaker: Studio.[18] He wanted to develop a role-playing game that was different from the traditional design, which he often found "boring to play".[19] He set out to develop a game with "interesting characters", and that "utilizes the medium as a storytelling device ... instead of having the story and gameplay abstractions be completely separate".[19]

			Fox worked on the entire game independently, besides some of the art; he decided to work independently to avoid relying on others.[16] Fox had little experience with game development; he and his three brothers often used RPG Maker 2000 to make role-playing games, though few were ever completed. Fox also worked on a number of EarthBound ROM hacks while in high school.[19] Temmie Chang worked as the main artistic assistant for the game, providing most of the sprites and concept art.[20] Fox has said that the game's art style would likely remain the same if he had access to a larger team of artists. He found that "there's a psychological thread that says audiences become more attached to characters drawn simply rather than in detail", particularly benefiting from the use of visual gags within the art.[21]

			Game design
			The defensive segment within the battle system was inspired by the Mario & Luigi series, as well as bullet hell shooters such as the Touhou Project series.[22] When working on the battle system, Fox set out to create a mechanic that he would personally enjoy.[23] He wanted Undertale to have a battle system as equally engaging as Super Mario RPG (1996) and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga (2003). Fox did not want grinding to be necessary at any point in the game, instead leaving it optional to players. He also did not wish to introduce fetch quests, as they involve backtracking, which he dislikes.[16] In terms of the game's difficulty, Fox ensured that it was easy and enjoyable. He asked some friends who are inexperienced with bullet hell shooters to test the game, and found that they were able to complete it. He felt that the game's difficulty is optimal, particularly considering the complications involved in adding another difficulty setting.[24]

			The game's dialogue system was inspired by Shin Megami Tensei (1992),[22] particularly the gameplay mechanic whereby players can talk to monsters to avoid conflict. Fox intended to expand upon this mechanic, as failing to negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight. "I want to create a system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters," he said.[3] When he began developing this mechanic, the concept of completing the game without killing any enemies "just evolved naturally".[25] However, he never considered removing the option to fight throughout development.[25] When questioned on the difficulty of playing the game without killing, Fox responded that it is "the crux of one of the major themes of this game", asking players to think about it themselves.[25]

			Writing
			For the game's writing, Fox was partly influenced by the silliness of internet culture, as well as comedy shows like Mr. Bean (1990–1995).[16] He was also inspired by the unsettling atmosphere of EarthBound (1994).[16] Fox's desire to "subvert concepts that go unquestioned in many games" further influenced Undertale's development.[25] Fox found that the writing became easier after establishing a character's voice and mood. He also felt that creating the world was a natural process, as it expressed the stories of those within it.[21] Fox felt the importance to make the game's monsters "feel like an individual".[22] He cited the Final Fantasy series (1987–present) as the opposite; "all monsters in RPGs like Final Fantasy are the same ... there's no meaning to that".[22]

			The character of Toriel, who is one of the first to appear in the game, was created as a parody of tutorial characters. Fox strongly disliked the use of the companion character Fi in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011), in which the answers to puzzles were often revealed early. Fox also felt that role-playing video games generally lack mother characters; in the Pokémon series (1996–present), as well as Mother (1989) and EarthBound, Fox felt that the mothers are used as "symbols rather than characters".[19] In response, Fox intended for Toriel's character to be "a mom that hopefully acts like a mom", and "genuinely cares" about players' actions.[19]

			Music

			"Hopes and Dreams"
			MENU0:00
			"Hopes and Dreams", a song from one of the game's final boss fights, was praised for reintroducing many of the game's previous themes in a different style.[26][27]

			The game's soundtrack was entirely composed by Fox. A self-taught musician, he composed most of the tracks with little iteration; the game's main theme, "Undertale", was the only song to undergo multiple iterations in development. The soundtrack was inspired by music from Super NES role-playing games,[16] such as EarthBound,[28] as well as the webcomic Homestuck, for which Fox provided some of the music.[16] Fox also stated that he tries to be inspired by all music he listens to,[23] particularly those in video games.[28] According to Fox, over 90% of the songs were composed specifically for the game.[18] "Megalovania", the song used during the boss battle with Sans, had previously been used within Homestuck and in one of Fox's EarthBound ROM hacks.[27] For each section of the game, Fox composed the music prior to programming, as it helped "decide how the scene should go".[18] He initially tried using a music tracker to compose the soundtrack, but found it difficult to use. He ultimately decided to play segments of the music separately, and connect them on a track.[28] To celebrate the one year anniversary of the game, Fox released five unused musical works on his blog in 2016.[29]

			Undertale's soundtrack has been well received by critics as part of the success of the game, in particular for its use of various leitmotifs for the various characters used throughout various tracks.[30][31] In particular, "Hopes and Dreams", the boss theme when fighting Asriel in the run-through where the player avoids killing any monster, brings back most of the main character themes, and is "a perfect way to cap off your journey", according to USgamer's Nadia Oxford.[27] Oxford notes this track in particular demonstrates Fox's ability to "turning old songs into completely new experiences", used throughout the game's soundtrack.[27] Tyler Hicks of GameSpot compared the music to "bit-based melodies".[32]
